          <h3>01 Interrupting Skimming Information</h3>
          <h4>A web-based reading experiment series</h4>
          <p>The first project, ‘Ways of Reading: Interrupting Skimming Information’, focused on enabling ‘deep reading’ in digital environments that typically encourage skimming. Recent studies have shown that a linear way of conventional reading approach of consuming content slowly and sequentially enhances comprehension and critical thinking. In line with this idea, the series of web experiments translates the traditional mode of sequential reading into a web environment by preventing users from skimming content and providing a slower, linear process of reading. The arrangement and movement of text with mouse interaction hinder the readers from skimming the content.

          <h3>02 A day in Hyde Park</h3>
          <h4>A hyperlink fiction</h4>
          <p>On the contrary, the second study, 'Ways of Reading: A Day in Hyde Park', challenges the negative perception of skimming information. The project presents an alternative form of reading based on the idea that exposure to extensive and fragmented information may potentially enhance concentration through the modified reading mode of the new generation, as Colomina and Wigley (2016) posit that humans have been redesigned by human-made tools. The text written at the edge and on different sides of folded papers symbolizes the fragmented data.

Immediate and abundant data through websites and social media platforms have transformed human reading habits, prompting individuals to selectively accept seemingly important information and skip the rest to obtain target information quickly. Consequently, skimming and scanning has become the predominant form of reading.</p></div>
